This means that the request is presented to the error page with the original HTTP method. If the error page is a static file, expected behaviour is to serve content of the file as if processing a GET request, regardless of the actual HTTP method.

JSPs used as error pages must must ensure that they handle any error dispatch as a GET request, regardless of the actual method.
