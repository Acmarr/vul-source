Description:
 Possible race condition in cleanup_exit() in openssh's privsep child,
 for openssh 8.7p1 and 8.8p1. `cleanup_exit()` gets called from
 the privsep child, which appears to call the non-asynchronous safe
 `do_cleanup()`, but possibly only post authentication (`the_authctxt
 != NULL`). Furthermore Red Hat 9 carries a specific patch that calls
 additional potentially unsafe cleanup functions.
