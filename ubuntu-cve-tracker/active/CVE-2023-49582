Description:
 Lax permissions set by the Apache Portable Runtime library on Unix
 platforms would allow local users read access to named shared memory
 segments, potentially revealing sensitive application data.
 
 This issue does not affect non-Unix platforms, or builds
 withÂ APR_USE_SHMEM_SHMGET=1 (apr.h)
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to APR version 1.7.5, which fixes this
 issue.
