Description:
 There's a out-of-bounds write issue in mpg123, the vulnerability is located
 when handling crafted streams. During the decoding of PCM the libmpg123 may
 write past the end of a heap located buffer, as consequence heap corruption
 may happen and arbitrary code execution is not discarded. The complexity
 required to exploit this flaw is considered high as the payload needs to be
 validated by the MPEG decoder and by the PCM synth before being
 executed. Additionally to successfully execute the attack,the user needs to
 scan through the stream making web live stream content (such as web radios)
 a very unlikely attack vector.
