Description:
 A vulnerability in the HTML parser of ClamAV could allow an
 unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
 condition on an affected device.
 The vulnerability is due to an issue in the C to Rust foreign function
 interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a
 crafted file containing HTML content to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected
 device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning
 process to terminate, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected
 software.
