Description:
 Validating the order of the public keys in the Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement
 Protocol, when an approved safe prime is used, allows remote attackers
 (from the client side) to trigger unnecessarily expensive server-side DHE
 modular-exponentiation calculations. The client may cause asymmetric
 resource consumption. The basic attack scenario is that the client must
 claim that it can only communicate with DHE, and the server must be
 configured to allow DHE and validate the order of the public key.
