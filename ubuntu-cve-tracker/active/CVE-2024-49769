Description:
 Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. When
 a remote client closes the connection before waitress has had the
 opportunity to call getpeername() waitress won't correctly clean up the
 connection leading to the main thread attempting to write to a socket that
 no longer exists, but not removing it from the list of sockets to attempt
 to process. This leads to a busy-loop calling the write function. A remote
 attacker could run waitress out of available sockets with very little
 resources required. Waitress 3.0.1 contains fixes that remove the race
 condition.
