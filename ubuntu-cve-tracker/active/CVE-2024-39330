Description:
 Derived classes of the django.core.files.storage.Storage base class which
 override generate_filename() without replicating the file path validations
 existing in the parent class, allow for potential directory-traversal via
 certain inputs when calling save(). Built-in Storage sub-classes were not
 affected by this vulnerability.
