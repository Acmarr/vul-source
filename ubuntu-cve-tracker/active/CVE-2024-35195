Description:
 Requests is a HTTP library. Prior to 2.32.0, when making requests through a
 Requests `Session`, if the first request is made with `verify=False` to
 disable cert verification, all subsequent requests to the same host will
 continue to ignore cert verification regardless of changes to the value of
 `verify`. This behavior will continue for the lifecycle of the connection
 in the connection pool. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.32.0.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> On focal and earlier, the python-pip package bundles requests
 mdeslaur> binaries when built. After updating requests, a no-change
 mdeslaur> rebuild of python-pip is required.
 mdeslaur> On jammy and later, requests is bundled in the python-pip
 mdeslaur> package and needs to be patched.
