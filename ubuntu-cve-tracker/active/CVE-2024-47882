Description:
 OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Prior
 to version 3.8.3, the built-in "Something went wrong!" error page includes
 the exception message and exception traceback without escaping HTML tags,
 enabling injection into the page if an attacker can reliably produce an
 error with an attacker-influenced message. It appears that the only way to
 reach this code in OpenRefine itself is for an attacker to somehow convince
 a victim to import a malicious file, which may be difficult.  However,
 out-of-tree extensions may add their own calls to `respondWithErrorPage`.
 Version 3.8.3 has a fix for this issue.
