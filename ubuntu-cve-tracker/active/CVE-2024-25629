Description:
 c-ares is a C library for asynchronous DNS requests. `ares__read_line()` is
 used to parse local configuration files such as `/etc/resolv.conf`,
 `/etc/nsswitch.conf`, the `HOSTALIASES` file, and if using a c-ares version
 prior to 1.27.0, the `/etc/hosts` file. If any of these configuration files
 has an embedded `NULL` character as the first character in a new line, it
 can lead to attempting to read memory prior to the start of the given
 buffer which may result in a crash. This issue is fixed in c-ares 1.27.0.
 No known workarounds exist.
