Description:
 In GNOME GdkPixbuf (aka gdk-pixbuf) through 2.42.10, the ANI (Windows
 animated cursor) decoder encounters heap memory corruption (in
 ani_load_chunk in io-ani.c) when parsing chunks in a crafted .ani file. A
 crafted file could allow an attacker to overwrite heap metadata, leading to
 a denial of service or code execution attack. This occurs in
 gdk_pixbuf_set_option() in gdk-pixbuf.c.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> Ubuntu packages do have the ANI loader enabled.
