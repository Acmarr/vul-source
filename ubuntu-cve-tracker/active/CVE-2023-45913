Description:
 Mesa v23.0.4 was discovered to contain a NULL pointer dereference via the
 function dri2GetGlxDrawableFromXDrawableId(). This vulnerability is
 triggered when the X11 server sends an DRI2_BufferSwapComplete event
 unexpectedly when the application is using DRI3. NOTE: this is disputed
 because there is no scenario in which the vulnerability was demonstrated.
