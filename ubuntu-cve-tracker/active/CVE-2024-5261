Description:
 Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice
 "LibreOfficeKit" mode disables TLS certification verification
 
 LibreOfficeKit can be used for accessing LibreOffice functionality
 through C/C++. Typically this is used by third party components to reuse
  LibreOffice as a library to convert, view or otherwise interact with
 documents.
 
 LibreOffice internally makes use of "curl" to fetch remote resources such
 as images hosted on webservers.
 
 In
  affected versions of LibreOffice, when used in LibreOfficeKit mode
 only, then curl's TLS certification verification was disabled
 (CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER of false)
 
 In the fixed versions curl operates in LibreOfficeKit mode the same as in
 standard mode with CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER of true.
 
 This issue affects LibreOffice before version 24.2.4.
