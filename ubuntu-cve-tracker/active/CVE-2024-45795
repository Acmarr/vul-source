Description:
 Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention
 System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.7,
 rules using datasets with the non-functional / unimplemented "unset" option
 can trigger an assertion during traffic parsing, leading to denial of
 service. This issue is addressed in 7.0.7. As a workaround, use only
 trusted and well tested rulesets.
