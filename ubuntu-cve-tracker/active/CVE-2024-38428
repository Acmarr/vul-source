Description:
 url.c in GNU Wget through 1.24.5 mishandles semicolons in the userinfo
 subcomponent of a URI, and thus there may be insecure behavior in which
 data that was supposed to be in the userinfo subcomponent is misinterpreted
 to be part of the host subcomponent.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> using semicolons in the userinfo component isn't a common
 mdeslaur> occurence, but a user could be tricked into thinking they are
 mdeslaur> connecting to a different host than they are in actuality
