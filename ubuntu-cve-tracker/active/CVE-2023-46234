Description:
 browserify-sign is a package to duplicate the functionality of node's
 crypto public key functions, much of this is based on Fedor Indutny's work
 on indutny/tls.js. An upper bound check issue in `dsaVerify` function
 allows an attacker to construct signatures that can be successfully
 verified by any public key, thus leading to a signature forgery attack. All
 places in this project that involve DSA verification of user-input
 signatures will be affected by this vulnerability. This issue has been
 patched in version 4.2.2.
