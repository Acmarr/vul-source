Description:
 A flaw was found in the Spring Framework. Applications serving static resources
 through the functional web frameworks WebMvc.fn or WebFlux.fn are vulnerable to
 path traversal attacks. This flaw allows an attacker to craft malicious HTTP requests
 and obtain any file on the file system that is also accessible to the process in which the Spring application is running.
