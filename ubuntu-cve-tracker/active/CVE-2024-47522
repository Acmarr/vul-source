Description:
 Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention
 System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.7,
 invalid ALPN in TLS/QUIC traffic when JA4 matching/logging is enabled can
 lead to Suricata aborting with a panic. This issue has been addressed in
 7.0.7. One may disable ja4 as a workaround.
