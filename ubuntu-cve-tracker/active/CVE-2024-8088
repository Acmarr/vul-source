Description:
 There is a HIGH severity vulnerability affecting the CPython "zipfile"
 module.
 
 
 
 
 
 When iterating over names of entries in a zip archive (for example, methods
 of "zipfile.ZipFile" like "namelist()", "iterdir()", "extractall()", etc)
 the process can be put into an infinite loop with a maliciously crafted
 zip archive. This defect applies when reading only metadata or extracting
 the contents of the zip archive. Programs that are not handling
 user-controlled zip archives are not affected.
