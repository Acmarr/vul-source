Description:
 Apfloat v1.10.1 was discovered to contain a NullPointerException via the
 component org.apfloat.internal.DoubleScramble::scramble(double[], int,
 int[]). NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who believe there
 was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability.
 The submission may have been based on a tool that is not sufficiently
 robust for vulnerability identification.
