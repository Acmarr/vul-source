Description:
 An attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of
 header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames.
 Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and
 CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed
 MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but
 they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint
 to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request
 which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded
 data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than
 for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess
 header frames we will process before closing a connection.

Notes:
 sbeattie> issue in net/http and net/http2 packages
 mdeslaur> Packages built using golang need to be rebuilt once the
 mdeslaur> vulnerability has been fixed. This CVE entry does not
 mdeslaur> list packages that need rebuilding outside of the main
 mdeslaur> repository or the Ubuntu variants with PPA overlays.
 mdeslaur> 
 mdeslaur> Warning: do not include nullboot in the list of no-change
 mdeslaur> rebuilds after fixing an issue in golang.
