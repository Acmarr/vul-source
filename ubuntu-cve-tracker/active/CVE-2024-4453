Description:
 GStreamer EXIF Metadata Parsing Integer Overflow Remote Code Execution
 Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code on affected installations of GStreamer. Interaction with
 this library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack vectors
 may vary depending on the implementation.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the parsing of EXIF metadata. The issue
 results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can
 result in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer. An attacker can
 leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current
 process.
 . Was ZDI-CAN-23896.
