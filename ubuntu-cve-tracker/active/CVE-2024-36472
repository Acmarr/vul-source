Description:
 In GNOME Shell through 45.7, a portal helper can be launched automatically
 (without user confirmation) based on network responses provided by an
 adversary (e.g., an adversary who controls the local Wi-Fi network), and
 subsequently loads untrusted JavaScript code, which may lead to resource
 consumption or other impacts depending on the JavaScript code's behavior.
