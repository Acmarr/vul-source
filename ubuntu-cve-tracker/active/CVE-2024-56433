Description:
 shadow-utils (aka shadow) 4.4 through 4.17.0 establishes a default
 /etc/subuid behavior (e.g., uid 100000 through 165535 for the first user
 account) that can realistically conflict with the uids of users defined on
 locally administered networks, potentially leading to account takeover,
 e.g., by leveraging newuidmap for access to an NFS home directory (or
 same-host resources in the case of remote logins by these local network
 users). NOTE: it may also be argued that system administrators should not
 have assigned uids, within local networks, that are within the range that
 can occur in /etc/subuid.
