Description:
 In PHP versions 8.1.* before 8.1.29, 8.2.* before 8.2.20, 8.3.* before
 8.3.8, due to a code logic error, filtering functions such as filter_var
 when validating URLs (FILTER_VALIDATE_URL) for certain types of URLs the
 function will result in invalid user information (username + password part
 of URLs) being treated as valid user information. This may lead to the
 downstream code accepting invalid URLs as valid and parsing them
 incorrectly.
