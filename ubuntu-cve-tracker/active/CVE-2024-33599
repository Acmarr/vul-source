Description:
 nscd: Stack-based buffer overflow in netgroup cache
 
 If the Name Service Cache Daemon's (nscd) fixed size cache is exhausted
 by client requests then a subsequent client request for netgroup data
 may result in a stack-based buffer overflow.  This flaw was introduced
 in glibc 2.15 when the cache was added to nscd.
 
 This vulnerability is only present in the nscd binary.
