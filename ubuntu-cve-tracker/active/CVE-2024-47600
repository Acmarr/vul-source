Description:
 GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling
 components. An OOB-read vulnerability has been detected in the
 format_channel_mask function in gst-discoverer.c. The vulnerability affects
 the local array position, which is defined with a fixed size of 64
 elements. However, the function gst_discoverer_audio_info_get_channels may
 return a guint channels value greater than 64. This causes the for loop to
 attempt access beyond the bounds of the position array, resulting in an
 OOB-read when an index greater than 63 is used. This vulnerability can
 result in reading unintended bytes from the stack. Additionally, the
 dereference of value->value_nick after the OOB-read can lead to further
 memory corruption or undefined behavior. This vulnerability is fixed in
 1.24.10.
