Description:
 Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework.
 Versions of Cacti prior to 1.2.27 contain a residual cross-site scripting
 vulnerability caused by an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-50250.
 `raise_message_javascript` from `lib/functions.php` now uses purify.js to
 fix CVE-2023-50250 (among others). However, it still generates the code out
 of unescaped PHP variables `$title` and `$header`. If those variables
 contain single quotes, they can be used to inject JavaScript code. An
 attacker exploiting this vulnerability could execute actions on behalf of
 other users. This ability to impersonate users could lead to unauthorized
 changes to settings. Version 1.2.27 fixes this issue.
