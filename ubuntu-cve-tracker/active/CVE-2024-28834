Description:
 A flaw was found in GnuTLS. The Minerva attack is a cryptographic
 vulnerability that exploits deterministic behavior in systems like GnuTLS,
 leading to side-channel leaks. In specific scenarios, such as when using
 the GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_FLAG_REPRODUCIBLE flag, it can result in a noticeable
 step in nonce size from 513 to 512 bits, exposing a potential timing
 side-channel.
