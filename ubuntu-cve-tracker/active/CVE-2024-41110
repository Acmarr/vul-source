Description:
 Moby is an open-source project created by Docker for software
 containerization. A security vulnerability has been detected in certain
 versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass
 authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base
 likelihood of this being exploited is low.
 
 Using a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the
 daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without
 the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a
 request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded
 to it.
 
 A security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass
 AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to
 unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue
 was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not
 carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone
 who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or
 response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.
 
 Docker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not
 vulnerable.
 
 docker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability. Patches have
 also been merged into the master, 19.03, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and
 26.1 release branches. If one is unable to upgrade immediately, avoid using
 AuthZ plugins and/or restrict access to the Docker API to trusted parties,
 following the principle of least privilege.
