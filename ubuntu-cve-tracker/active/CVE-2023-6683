Description:
 A flaw was found in the QEMU built-in VNC server while processing
 ClientCutText messages. The qemu_clipboard_request() function can be
 reached before vnc_server_cut_text_caps() was called and had the chance to
 initialize the clipboard peer, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. This
 could allow a malicious authenticated VNC client to crash QEMU and trigger
 a denial of service.
