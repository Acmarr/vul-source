 https://github.com/idhyt/pocs/blob/main/libyaml/CVE-2024-35326.c
Description:
 libyaml v0.2.5 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. Affected by this issue is
 the function yaml_emitter_emit of the file /src/libyaml/src/emitter.c. The
 manipulation leads to a double-free.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> golang-goyaml is a go translation of libyaml and shouldn't share
 jdstrand> implementation flaws, but may share design flaws
 mdeslaur> There are no details about a fix for this vulnerability or a
 mdeslaur> comment from the upstream developers as of 2024-06-19, but like
 mdeslaur> the other CVEs from the same reporter this is likely a misuse
 mdeslaur> of the API and the CVE will likely get rejected. Marking as
 mdeslaur> deferred for now to make sure.
