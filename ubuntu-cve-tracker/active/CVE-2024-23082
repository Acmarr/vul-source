Description:
 ThreeTen Backport v1.6.8 was discovered to contain an integer overflow via
 the component org.threeten.bp.format.DateTimeFormatter::parse(CharSequence,
 ParsePosition). NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who
 believe there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a
 vulnerability. The submission may have been based on a tool that is not
 sufficiently robust for vulnerability identification.
