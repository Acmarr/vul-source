Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** JFreeChart v1.5.4 was discovered to be vulnerable to
 ArrayIndexOutOfBounds via the component /chart/plot/CompassPlot.java. NOTE:

 reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability. The
 submission may have been based on a tool that is not sufficiently robust
 for vulnerability identification.
