Description:
 An issue was discovered in Sangoma Asterisk through 18.20.0, 19.x and 20.x
 through 20.5.0, and 21.x through 21.0.0, and Certified Asterisk through
 18.9-cert5. In manager.c, the functions action_getconfig() and
 action_getconfigJson() do not process the input file path, resulting in a
 path traversal vulnerability. In versions without the restrictedFile()
 function, no processing is done on the input path. In versions with the
 restrictedFile() function, path traversal is not processed.
