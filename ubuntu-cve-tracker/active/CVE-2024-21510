Description:
 Versions of the package sinatra from 0.0.0 are vulnerable to Reliance on
 Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision via the X-Forwarded-Host (XFH)
 header. When making a request to a method with redirect applied, it is
 possible to trigger an Open Redirect Attack by inserting an arbitrary
 address into this header. If used for caching purposes, such as with
 servers like Nginx, or as a reverse proxy, without handling the
 X-Forwarded-Host header, attackers can potentially exploit Cache Poisoning
 or Routing-based SSRF.
