Description:
 A double free vulnerability was found in QEMU virtio devices (virtio-gpu,
 virtio-serial-bus, virtio-crypto), where the mem_reentrancy_guard flag
 insufficiently protects against DMA reentrancy issues. This issue could
 allow a malicious privileged guest to crash the QEMU process on the host,
 resulting in a denial of service or allow arbitrary code execution within
 the context of the QEMU process on the host.
