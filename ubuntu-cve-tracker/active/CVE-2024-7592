Description:
 There is a LOW severity vulnerability affecting CPython, specifically the
 'http.cookies' standard library module.
 
 
 When parsing cookies that contained backslashes for quoted characters in
 the cookie value, the parser would use an algorithm with quadratic
 complexity, resulting in excess CPU resources being used while parsing the
 value.
