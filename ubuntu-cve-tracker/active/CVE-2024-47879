Description:
 OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Prior
 to version 3.8.3, lack of cross-site request forgery protection on the
 `preview-expression` command means that visiting a malicious website could
 cause an attacker-controlled expression to be executed. The expression can
 contain arbitrary Clojure or Python code. The attacker must know a valid
 project ID of a project that contains at least one row, and the attacker
 must convince the victim to open a malicious webpage. Version 3.8.3 fixes
 the issue.
