Description:
 OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Prior
 to version 3.8.3, the `export-rows` command can be used in such a way that
 it reflects part of the request verbatim, with a Content-Type header also
 taken from the request. An attacker could lead a user to a malicious page
 that submits a form POST that contains  embedded JavaScript code. This code
 would then be included in the response, along with an attacker-controlled
 `Content-Type` header, and so potentially executed in the victim's browser
 as if it was part of OpenRefine. The attacker-provided code can do anything
 the user can do, including deleting projects, retrieving database
 passwords, or executing arbitrary Jython or Closure expressions, if those
 extensions are also present. The attacker must know a valid project ID of a
 project that contains at least one row. Version 3.8.3 fixes the issue.
