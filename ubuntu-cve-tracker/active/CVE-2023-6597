Description:
 An issue was found in the CPython `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` class
 affecting versions 3.12.2, 3.11.8, 3.10.13, 3.9.18, and 3.8.18 and prior.
 The tempfile.TemporaryDirectory class would dereference symlinks during
 cleanup of permissions-related errors. This means users which can run
 privileged programs are potentially able to modify permissions of files
 referenced by symlinks in some circumstances.
