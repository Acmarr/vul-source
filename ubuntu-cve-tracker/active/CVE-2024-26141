Description:
 Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Carefully crafted Range
 headers can cause a server to respond with an unexpectedly large response.
 Responding with such large responses could lead to a denial of service
 issue. Vulnerable applications will use the `Rack::File` middleware or the
 `Rack::Utils.byte_ranges` methods (this includes Rails applications). The
 vulnerability is fixed in 3.0.9.1 and 2.2.8.1.
