Description:
 Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework.
 Prior to version 1.2.27, some of the data stored in
 `automation_tree_rules_form_save()` function in `automation_tree_rules.php`
 is not thoroughly checked and is used to concatenate the HTML statement in
 `form_confirm()` function from `lib/html.php` , finally resulting in
 cross-site scripting. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for the issue.
