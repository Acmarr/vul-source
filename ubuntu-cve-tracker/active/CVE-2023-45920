Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Xfig v3.2.8 was discovered to contain a NULL pointer
 dereference when calling XGetWMHints(). NOTE: this is disputed because it
 is not expected that an X application should continue to run when there is
 arbitrary anomalous behavior from the X server or window manager.
