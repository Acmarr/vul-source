Description:
 Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications, supporting
 Python 3.6+. The `twisted.web.util.redirectTo` function contains an HTML
 injection vulnerability. If application code allows an attacker to control
 the redirect URL this vulnerability may result in Reflected Cross-Site
 Scripting (XSS) in the redirect response HTML body. This vulnerability is
 fixed in 24.7.0rc1.
