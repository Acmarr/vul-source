Description:
 fprintd through 1.94.3 lacks a security attention mechanism, and thus
 unexpected actions might be authorized by "auth sufficient pam_fprintd.so"
 for Sudo. NOTE: the supplier disputes this because they believe issue
 resolution would involve modifying the PAM configuration to restrict
 pam_fprintd.so to front-ends that implement a proper attention mechanism,
 not modifying pam_fprintd.so or fprintd.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> This isn't really a vulnerability in fprintd, it's a limitation
 mdeslaur> when command-line applications use pam for authentication. See
 mdeslaur> mailing list discussion, this CVE may get rejected. Marking as
 mdeslaur> deferred for now.
