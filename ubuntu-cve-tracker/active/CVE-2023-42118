Description:
 Exim libspf2 Integer Underflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This
 vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code
 on affected installations of Exim libspf2. Authentication is not required
 to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the parsing
 of SPF macros. When parsing SPF macros, the process does not properly
 validate user-supplied data, which can result in an integer underflow
 before writing to memory. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to
 execute code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-17578.
