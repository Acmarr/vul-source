Description:
 Vim is an open source command line text editor. double-free in
 dialog_changed() in Vim < v9.1.0648. When abandoning a buffer, Vim may ask
 the user what to do with the modified buffer. If the user wants the changed
 buffer to be saved, Vim may create a new Untitled file, if the buffer did
 not have a name yet. However, when setting the buffer name to Unnamed, Vim
 will falsely free a pointer twice, leading to a double-free and possibly
 later to a heap-use-after-free, which can lead to a crash. The issue has
 been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0648.
