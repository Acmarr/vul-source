Description:
 A flaw was found in the virtio-net device in QEMU. When enabling the RSS
 feature on the virtio-net network card, the indirections_table data within
 RSS becomes controllable. Setting excessively large values may cause an
 index out-of-bounds issue, potentially resulting in heap overflow access.
 This flaw allows a privileged user in the guest to crash the QEMU process
 on the host.
