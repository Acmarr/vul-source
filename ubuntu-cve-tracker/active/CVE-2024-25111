Description:
 Squid is a web proxy cache. Starting in version 3.5.27 and prior to version
 6.8, Squid may be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against HTTP
 Chunked decoder due to an uncontrolled recursion bug. This problem allows a
 remote attacker to cause Denial of Service when sending a crafted, chunked,
 encoded HTTP Message. This bug is fixed in Squid version 6.8. In addition,
 patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in
 Squid's patch archives. There is no workaround for this issue.
