Description:
 WebOb provides objects for HTTP requests and responses. When WebOb
 normalizes the HTTP Location header to include the request hostname, it
 does so by parsing the URL that the user is to be redirected to with
 Python's urlparse, and joining it to the base URL. `urlparse` however
 treats a `//` at the start of a string as a URI without a scheme, and then
 treats the next part as the hostname. `urljoin` will then use that hostname
 from the second part as the hostname replacing the original one from the
 request. This vulnerability is patched in WebOb version 1.8.8.
