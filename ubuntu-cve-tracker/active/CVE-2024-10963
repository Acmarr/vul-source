Description:
 A flaw was found in pam_access, where certain rules in its configuration
 file are mistakenly treated as hostnames. This vulnerability allows
 attackers to trick the system by pretending to be a trusted hostname,
 gaining unauthorized access. This issue poses a risk for systems that rely
 on this feature to control who can access certain services or terminals.
