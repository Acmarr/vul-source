Description:
 A vulnerability was found in pam_access due to the improper handling of
 tokens in access.conf, interpreted as hostnames. This flaw allows attackers
 to bypass access restrictions by spoofing hostnames, undermining
 configurations designed to limit access to specific TTYs or services. The
 flaw poses a risk in environments relying on these configurations for local
 access control.
