Description:
 A flaw was found in ofono, an Open Source Telephony on Linux. A stack
 overflow bug is triggered within the decode_deliver_report() function
 during the SMS decoding. It is assumed that the attack scenario is
 accessible from a compromised modem, a malicious base station, or just SMS.
 There is a bound check for this memcpy length in decode_submit(), but it
 was forgotten in decode_deliver_report().
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> Fedora seems to think that this was fixed in ofono 2.5;
  however, while that release does seem to add some additional bounds
  checks, the specific function referenced has not been touched since
  2010. It's not clear if or how this was fixed upstream.
