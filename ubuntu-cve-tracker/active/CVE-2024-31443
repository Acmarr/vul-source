Description:
 Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework.
 Prior to 1.2.27, some of the data stored in `form_save()` function in
 `data_queries.php` is not thoroughly checked and is used to concatenate the
 HTML statement in `grow_right_pane_tree()` function from `lib/html.php` ,
 finally resulting in cross-site scripting. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch
 for the issue.
