Description:
 Puma is a Ruby/Rack web server built for parallelism. In affected versions
 clients could clobber values set by intermediate proxies (such as
 X-Forwarded-For) by providing a underscore version of the same header
 (X-Forwarded_For). Any users relying on proxy set variables is affected.
 v6.4.3/v5.6.9 now discards any headers using underscores if the
 non-underscore version also exists. Effectively, allowing the proxy defined
 headers to always win. Users are advised to upgrade. Nginx has a
 underscores_in_headers configuration variable to discard these headers at
 the proxy level as a mitigation. Any users that are implicitly trusting the
 proxy defined headers for security should immediately cease doing so until
 upgraded to the fixed versions.
