Description:
 Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4,
 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, repositories with submodules can be
 crafted in a way that exploits a bug in Git whereby it can be fooled into
 writing files not into the submodule's worktree but into a `.git/`
 directory. This allows writing a hook that will be executed while the clone
 operation is still running, giving the user no opportunity to inspect the
 code that is being executed. The problem has been patched in versions
 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. If symbolic
 link support is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git config --global
 core.symlinks false`), the described attack won't work. As always, it is
 best to avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources.
