Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Mismatches in interpreting USB authorization policy between
 GNOME Settings Daemon (GSD) through 46.0 and the Linux kernel's underlying
 device matching logic allow a physically proximate attacker to access some
 unintended Linux kernel USB functionality, such as USB device-specific
 kernel modules and filesystem implementations. NOTE: the GSD supplier
 indicates that consideration of a mitigation for this within GSD would be
 in the context of "a new feature, not a CVE."
