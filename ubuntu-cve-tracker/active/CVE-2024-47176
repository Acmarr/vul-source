Description:
 CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and `cups-browsed`
 contains network printing functionality including, but not limited to,
 auto-discovering print services and shared printers. `cups-browsed` binds
 to `INADDR_ANY:631`, causing it to trust any packet from any source, and
 can cause the `Get-Printer-Attributes` IPP request to an attacker
 controlled URL.
 
 Due to the service binding to `*:631 ( INADDR_ANY )`, multiple bugs in
 `cups-browsed` can be exploited in sequence to introduce a malicious
 printer to the system. This chain of exploits ultimately enables an
 attacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely on the target machine
 without authentication when a print job is started. This poses a
 significant security risk over the network. Notably, this vulnerability is
 particularly concerning as it can be exploited from the public internet,
 potentially exposing a vast number of systems to remote attacks if their
 CUPS services are enabled.
