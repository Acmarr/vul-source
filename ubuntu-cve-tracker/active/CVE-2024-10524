Description:
 It has been discovered that when using the HTTP shorthand format with
 user-provided input, unexpected behavior may occur. Wget might issue an
 FTP request to a different host - a potentially attacker-controlled host
 or a restricted host which the user normally does not have access to. This
 SSRF vulnerability can be the starting point for many types of attacks.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> the upstream fix removes shorthand support for URLs. Fixing this
 mdeslaur> will change behaviour and may break existing uses of wget.
