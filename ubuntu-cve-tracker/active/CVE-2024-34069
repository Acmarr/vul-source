Description:
 Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. The debugger in
 affected versions of Werkzeug can allow an attacker to execute code on a
 developer's machine under some circumstances. This requires the attacker to
 get the developer to interact with a domain and subdomain they control, and
 enter the debugger PIN, but if they are successful it allows access to the
 debugger even if it is only running on localhost. This also requires the
 attacker to guess a URL in the developer's application that will trigger
 the debugger. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.0.3.
