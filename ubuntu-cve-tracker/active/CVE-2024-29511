Description:
 Artifex Ghostscript before 10.03.1, when Tesseract is used for OCR, has a
 directory traversal issue that allows arbitrary file reading (and writing
 of error messages to arbitrary files) via OCRLanguage. For example,
 exploitation can use debug_file /tmp/out and user_patterns_file
 /etc/passwd.
