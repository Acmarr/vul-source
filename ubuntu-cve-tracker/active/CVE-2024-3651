Description:
 A vulnerability was identified in the kjd/idna library, specifically within
 the `idna.encode()` function, affecting version 3.6. The issue arises from
 the function's handling of crafted input strings, which can lead to
 quadratic complexity and consequently, a denial of service condition. This
 vulnerability is triggered by a crafted input that causes the
 `idna.encode()` function to process the input with considerable
 computational load, significantly increasing the processing time in a
 quadratic manner relative to the input size.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> On focal and earlier, the python-pip package bundles
 mdeslaur> python-idna binaries when built. After updating
 mdeslaur> python-idna, a no-change rebuild of python-pip is required.
 mdeslaur> On jammy and later, python-idna is bundled in the python-pip
 mdeslaur> package and needs to be patched.
