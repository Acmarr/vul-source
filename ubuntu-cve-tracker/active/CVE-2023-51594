Description:
 BlueZ OBEX Library Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure Vulnerability.
 This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive
 information on affected installations of BlueZ. User interaction is
 required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must connect to a
 malicious Bluetooth device. The specific flaw exists within the handling of
 OBEX protocol parameters. The issue results from the lack of proper
 validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end
 of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with
 other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was
 ZDI-CAN-20937.
