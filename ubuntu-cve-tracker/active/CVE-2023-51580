Description:
 BlueZ Audio Profile AVRCP avrcp_parse_attribute_list Out-Of-Bounds Read
 Information Disclosure Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows
 network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information via Bluetooth
 on affected installations of BlueZ. User interaction is required to exploit
 this vulnerability in that the target must connect to a malicious device.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the handling of the AVRCP protocol. The
 issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data,
 which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker
 can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute
 arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-20852.
