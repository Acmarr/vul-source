Description:
 CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and cups-filters
 provides backends, filters, and other software for CUPS 2.x to use on
 non-Mac OS systems. Any value passed to `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` via a PPD
 file will be executed as a user controlled command. When combined with
 other logic bugs as described in CVE_2024-47176, this can lead to remote
 command execution.
