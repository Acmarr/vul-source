Description:
 Certificate Validation user interface in LibreOffice allows potential
 vulnerability.
 
 
 
 
 Signed macros are scripts that have been digitally signed by the
 developer using a cryptographic signature. When a document with a signed
  macro is opened a warning is displayed by LibreOffice before the macro
 is executed.
 
 Previously if verification failed the user could fail to understand the
 failure and choose to enable the macros anyway.
 
 
 This issue affects LibreOffice: from 24.2 before 24.2.5.
