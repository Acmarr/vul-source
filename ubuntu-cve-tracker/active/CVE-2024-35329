Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** libyaml 0.2.5 is vulnerable to a heap-based Buffer Overflow
 in yaml_document_add_sequence in api.c. NOTE: the supplier disputes this
 because the finding represents a user error. The problem is that the
 application, which was making use of the libyaml library, omitted the
 required calls to the yaml_document_initialize and yaml_document_delete
 functions.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> golang-goyaml is a go translation of libyaml and shouldn't share
 jdstrand> implementation flaws, but may share design flaws
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> Per upstream developers, the PoC code is wrong and they will
 mdeslaur> request that the CVE be rejected. Marking as deferred until it
 mdeslaur> is, just to make sure.
