Description:
 OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Prior
 to version 3.8.3, the `/extension/gdata/authorized` endpoint includes the
 `state` GET parameter verbatim in a `<script>` tag in the output, so
 without escaping. An attacker could lead or redirect a user to a crafted
 URL containing JavaScript code, which would then cause that code to be
 executed in the victim's browser as if it was part of OpenRefine. Version
 3.8.3 fixes this issue.
