Description:
 When asked to both use a `.netrc` file for credentials and to follow HTTP
 redirects, curl could leak the password used for the first host to the
 followed-to host under certain circumstances.
 
 This flaw only manifests itself if the netrc file has an entry that matches
 the redirect target hostname but the entry either omits just the password
 or
 omits both login and password.
