 vulnerability is VDB-259052. NOTE: The vendor was contacted early about
 this disclosure but did not respond in any way.

Notes:
 jdstrand> golang-goyaml is a go translation of libyaml and shouldn't share
 jdstrand> implementation flaws, but may share design flaws
 sbeattie> as of 2024-04-15, fix has not landed upstream.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> libyaml-libyaml-perl, golang-goyaml, and golang-yaml.v2 are
 mdeslaur> unrelated codebases.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> This appears to be an issue with the fuzzer, not libyaml itself:
