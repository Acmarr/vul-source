Description:
 In all versions of GitLab CE/EE since version 8.0, an attacker can set the
 pipeline schedules to be active in a project export so when an unsuspecting
 owner imports that project, pipelines are active by default on that
 project. Under specialized conditions, this may lead to information
 disclosure if the project is imported from an untrusted source.
