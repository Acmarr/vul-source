Description:
 libcurl's ASN1 parser code has the `GTime2str()` function, used for
 parsing an ASN.1 Generalized Time field. If given an syntactically
 incorrect field, the parser might end up using -1 for the length
 of the *time fraction*, leading to a `strlen()` getting performed
 on a pointer to a heap buffer area that is not (purposely) null
 terminated. This flaw most likely leads to a crash, but can also
 lead to heap contents getting returned to the application when
 CURLINFO_CERTINFO is used.
