Description:
 Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework.
 Prior to version 1.2.27, Cacti calls `compat_password_hash` when users set
 their password. `compat_password_hash` use `password_hash` if there is it,
 else use `md5`. When verifying password, it calls `compat_password_verify`.
 In `compat_password_verify`, `password_verify` is called if there is it,
 else use `md5`. `password_verify` and `password_hash` are supported on PHP
 < 5.5.0, following PHP manual. The vulnerability is in
 `compat_password_verify`. Md5-hashed user input is compared with correct
 password in database by `$md5 == $hash`. It is a loose comparison, not
 `===`. It is a type juggling vulnerability. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch
 for the issue.
