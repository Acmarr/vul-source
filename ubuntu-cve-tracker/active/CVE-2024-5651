Description:
 A flaw was found in the Fence Agents Remediation operator. This
 vulnerability can allow a Remote Code Execution (RCE) primitive by
 supplying an arbitrary command to execute in the --ssh-path/--telnet-path
 arguments. A low-privilege user, for example, a user with developer access,
 can create a specially crafted FenceAgentsRemediation for a fence agent
 supportingÂ  --ssh-path/--telnet-path arguments to execute arbitrary
 commands on the operator's pod. This RCE leads to a privilege escalation,
 first as the service account running the operator, then to another service
 account with cluster-admin privileges.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> I don't believe this affects the fence-agents package in Ubuntu
 mdeslaur> as the Red Hat advisory states "This vulnerability is specific
 mdeslaur> to the Fence Agents Remediation operator and does not affect
 mdeslaur> fence-agents itself." and the string "FenceAgentsRemediation"
 mdeslaur> isn't in the fence-agents package. Marking as deferred for now.
