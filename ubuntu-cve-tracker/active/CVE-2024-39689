Description:
 Certifi is a curated collection of Root Certificates for validating the
 trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the identity of TLS
 hosts. Certifi starting in 2021.05.30 and prior to 2024.07.4 recognized
 root certificates from `GLOBALTRUST`. Certifi 2024.07.04 removes root
 certificates from `GLOBALTRUST` from the root store. These are in the
 process of being removed from Mozilla's trust store. `GLOBALTRUST`'s root
 certificates are being removed pursuant to an investigation which
 identified "long-running and unresolved compliance issues."
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> On focal and earlier, the python-pip package bundles
 mdeslaur> python-certifi binaries when built. After updating
 mdeslaur> python-certifi, a no-change rebuild of python-pip is required.
 mdeslaur> On jammy and later, python-certifi is bundled in the python-pip
 mdeslaur> package and needs to be patched.
