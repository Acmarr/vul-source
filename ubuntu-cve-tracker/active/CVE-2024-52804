Description:
 Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. The
 algorithm used for parsing HTTP cookies in Tornado versions prior to 6.4.2
 sometimes has quadratic complexity, leading to excessive CPU consumption
 when parsing maliciously-crafted cookie headers. This parsing occurs in the
 event loop thread and may block the processing of other requests. Version
 6.4.2 fixes the issue.
