Description:
 mod/forum/post.php in Moodle 2.9.x before 2.9.1 does not consider the
 mod/forum:canposttomygroups capability before authorizing "Post a copy to
 all groups" actions, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass
 intended access restrictions by leveraging per-group authorization.
