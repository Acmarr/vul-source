Description:
 A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the ub_ctx_set_fwd function in
 Unbound. This issue could allow an attacker who can invoke specific
 sequences of API calls to cause a segmentation fault. When certain API
 functions such as ub_ctx_set_fwd and ub_ctx_resolvconf are called in a
 particular order, the program attempts to read from a NULL pointer, leading
 to a crash. This issue can result in a denial of service by causing the
 application to terminate unexpectedly.
